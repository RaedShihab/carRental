# car rental project
the main idea is a car rental web site, where I can make a connection between normal client that want to rent a car and between the company that has cars and it want to rent this cars, so this serves for both.

## the stack
I used react for front end, beacuse it is a single page website and I have some components and I want to render quiqly and interact with each other,
for backend I used express server with mysql database beacuse I need relations between tables.

## requairments 
- npm install
- npm start

## opining the app
- cd my-app
- npm start
- node server.js
